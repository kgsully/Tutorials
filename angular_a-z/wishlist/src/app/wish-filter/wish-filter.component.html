NOTES:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The bracket syntax [] speficies a binding of an attribute/property. If there is no property, use the attr. prefix to specify it is an attribute
2. The parenthesis syntax () specifies binding of an event to a function in the class, similar to the syntax -> onclick
3. [(ngModel)] allows us to specify that we want to bind the value of the input with a property on the class
4. Event (ngModelChange) only occurs when bound ngModel value changes and it will call the callback function specified. As such, this event
   can only be used on elements that use the ngModel directive (wouldn't make sense to use it otherwise)
5. When using the event binding (ngModelChange), the $event passed into the bound method is NOT a normal event,
   but actually contains new value of the model
6. Could define a function within the component TS file to perform this functionality, but is arguably more readable and easier to just define the
   functionality in-line
7. The $event object passed by items.push($event) is NOT a normal event, but contains the VALUE from the event emitter from the add-wish-form component
General:
G1. for the event bindings such as (click), you can pass $event to the function and it will pass the entire event to the component for use
    which will give a lot of info about the event itself

<div class="col-sm-2">
    <!-- See notes 4, & 5 -->
    <!-- To use ngModelChange event, add the following to the <select> attributes/properties after [(ngModel)] -->
    <select
      class="form-select"
      name="list-filter"
      [(ngModel)]="listFilter"
      (ngModelChange)="changeFilter($event)"
    >
      <option value="0">All</option>
      <option value="1">Unfulfilled</option>
      <option value="2">Fulfilled</option>
    </select>
  </div>
